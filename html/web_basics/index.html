    <em>Lumberjack</em> is a historical term, associated with folklore and of times past, to refer to what we today call 'loggers'.  The term <em>lumberjack</em> is first credited to be used in reference to a group of unruly <strong>Canadian</strong> men who made a living working in the wild forest, and could not be subjected to the constraints of civil law.
