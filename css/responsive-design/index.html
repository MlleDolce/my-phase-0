    <p>You've seen it on Pinterest and in all the hottest decorating magazines: the biggest new thing in decor is just leaving some flowers in the ground, right where you found them.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "We call it 'decorating via proximity,' or 'DecProx' for short. Basically, <em>you</em> go to the decor, instead of the other way around. It's an organic, all-natural approach to living that is as cost-effective as it is intuitive."
      <cite>Dean Hortenz, Designer</cite>

    <p>The DecProx craze seems to have sprouted up out of nowhere, and is now in full bloom, especially along the coasts.</p>
    <p>"I think it's the flexibility that is really working for people," said Dean Hortenz, the inventor of DecProx and the author of the bestseller <em>The Outdoor Home: Repurposing Fields as Social Spaces</em>. "You don't just have to stand near found decor. You can dine near it, nap near it, and even dance near it. You can't really beat the price point, either."</p>
