8.4 Release 3: Queries.text

1.  In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.

2.  You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
-- With Inner Join.

SELECT * FROM businesses, users INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|Mandy|Kaling|1|5|Best l'il chapel in the world!|1|2
2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie|2|2|Awful service. Waited 2.5hrs before someone came to tow me|2|3
3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bradford|Pitt|3|3.5|Awesome night with the boys! Highly recommend|3|1

3.  There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT 
businesses.name, 
users.first_name, 
users.last_name, 
reviews.stars, 
reviews.comment 

FROM businesses
INNER JOIN users 
INNER JOIN reviews 
ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id;

4.  How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, reviews.business_id, reviews.user_id FROM reviews 
LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id 
LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
WHERE businesses.name="Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
